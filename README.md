## 🤷 About
We envisioned the project to solve the problems faced by 21st-century learners. A modern learner finds a flood of resources from Google Search but doesn't always find the right resources since it's the app that wins. There are so many free resources available on the internet made by experts in their field and yet we pay for outdated courses promoted by big companies and universities.

With Footsteps [app](https://github.com/fnplus/footsteps-app) & [browser extension](https://github.com/fnplus/footsteps-extension), we take a mentor/subject knowledge expert first approach to solve the problem. The domain experts save their learning journey with our app and browser extension & make it available for everyone else to follow. Every resource is called a 'footstep' (added in a chronological manner) and a collection of footsteps makes up a learning path. The learner can "fork" the learning path made by the expert and keep a track of his progress. The app suggests resources & keeps an updated list with users upvotes & collaborative filtering.
