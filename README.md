## 🤷 About
This is the companion native app for  [footsteps-app](https://github.com/fnplus/footsteps-app) .This cross-platform application is being developed for the Android and iOS platforms using the Flutter SDK by Google. 

With Footsteps [app](https://github.com/fnplus/footsteps-flutter-app) & [browser extension](https://github.com/fnplus/footsteps-extension), we take a mentor/subject knowledge expert first approach to solve the problem. This flutter app would help individuals to add/manage links in their learning paths. It works just like the browser extension is working right now.
